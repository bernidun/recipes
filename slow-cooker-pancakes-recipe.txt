Ingredients:
 - 2 cups all purpose flour
 - ¼ cup sugar
 - 2 teaspoons baking powder
 - 1 teaspoon baking soda
 - 1 teaspoon salt
 - 1¾ cup buttermilk
 - 4 tablespoons butter, melted and cooled a bit
 - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
 - 1 cup frozen or fresh blueberries
 - 2 eggs

Directions:
1. Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in medium bowl
2. In a large bowl add buttermilk, butter, eggs, and vanilla and whisk together
3. Slowly add dry mixture to wet ingredients and stir until no lumps remain
4. Carefully fold in blueberries, careful not to stir very much if you are using frozen or the color will bleed into your batter
5. Spray crock very well with nonstick spray
6. Poor batter into crock and cover
7. Cook on high for 2 hours until edges are slightly browned and the center is fully cooked through
8. Let cool uncovered for 10 minutes then slice and serve

Notes:
Use a larger oval crock (I used a 6 quart) so that the batter will be thin enough to cook evenly
